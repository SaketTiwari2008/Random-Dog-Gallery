# 🐾 Random Dog Gallery

**Random Dog Gallery** is a simple and fun web project that fetches and displays random dog images using the free [Dog CEO API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/).  
With a clean UI and a **Load More** feature, users can keep browsing an endless gallery of cute dogs 🐕.

## 🚀 Features
- Fetches random dog images from a public API.
- Displays **5 images at a time** in a responsive gallery.
- "Load More" button loads **only new images** (previous ones are not reloaded).
- Colorful random background for each image container.
- Built with pure **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.
