# Random-Dog-Gallery
Random Dog Gallery is a simple yet fun web project that fetches and displays random dog images using the free Dog CEO API . The main goal of this project is to practice working with APIs, asynchronous JavaScript (fetch), and dynamic content rendering while keeping the design clean and user-friendly.
